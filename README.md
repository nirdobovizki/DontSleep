# DontSleep
Temporarily prevent your computer from going to sleep

This is a small app that prevent the computer from automatically going to sleep while it is on,
to re-enable sleep just close the app.

This app doesn't change any configuration, it just tells Windows "I'm doing something importent, don't geo to sleep now"

I wrote this when I used Cura to directly control my 3D printer and if the computer went to sleep it would have ruin the 
print
